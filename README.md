# BrainScore
Making mental wellness as measurable as physical fitness

**üß† BrainScore: Real-Time Brain Health Monitoring with EEG + AI**

**The Problem**

Mental wellness often goes unnoticed ‚Äî not because it‚Äôs invisible, but because we don‚Äôt have the tools to track it like we do heart rate or weight. Most current methods rely on self-reported forms and generic assumptions, making mental clarity hard to quantify or improve.

**BrainScore‚Äôs Mission**

To help people understand and track their brain health, in real-time, using non-invasive EEG signals and explainable AI ‚Äî all through an easy-to-use interface. Whether you're a student, professional, or athlete, BrainScore helps you measure and improve your focus, clarity, and mental performance.
