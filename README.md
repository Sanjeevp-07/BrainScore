# BrainScore
Making mental wellness as measurable as physical fitness

**🧠 BrainScore: Real-Time Brain Health Monitoring with EEG + AI**

**The Problem**

Mental wellness often goes unnoticed — not because it’s invisible, but because we don’t have the tools to track it like we do heart rate or weight. Most current methods rely on self-reported forms and generic assumptions, making mental clarity hard to quantify or improve.

**BrainScore’s Mission**

To help people understand and track their brain health, in real-time, using non-invasive EEG signals and explainable AI — all through an easy-to-use interface. Whether you're a student, professional, or athlete, BrainScore helps you measure and improve your focus, clarity, and mental performance.
